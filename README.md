# UI Techinal Assessment


## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository [UI Technical Assessment](https://github.com/)
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the Angular Application.
4. Run `npm start:mock-api` to start the mock API.
5. Run `npm start:dev` to start the mock API and the Angular application at once.

## Technical Decisions
- **Folder Structure**: Modular structure seperates core, shared, and features for scalability.
- **Mock API**: Used json-server to simulate backend interactions for development purposes.
- **Styling**: SCSS chosen for better maintainability and adherence to desgn system.
- **Linting**: Configured ESLint and Prettier for clean and consistend code formatting.
